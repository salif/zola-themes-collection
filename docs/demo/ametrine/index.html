While it’s not very feasible to make things look overly realistic, some edge highlights, nice shadows, and a vibrant palette make a big difference. The design system that Ametrine uses is made of slightly frosted colored acrylic, everything is rounded, but the edges are not so rounded, so the edge highlight is rather thin, you can think of it as Lego bricks, fun and nice to touch. The animations are very bouncy to raise the fun level even higher. Still, the balance between fun and not being annoying is maintained. Did I succeed with this premise? I don’t know, you tell me :P<h2 id=to-do><a aria-label="Anchor link for: to-do" class=zola-anchor href=#to-do><i class=icon
