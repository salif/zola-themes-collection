Because of this, it brought a lot of people to Neiwan in the 1950s. The streets mainly developed from Zhongzheng Road to Guangfu Road, Datong Road, Heping Street, Zhongshan Street and Guangji Road, which were all crowded with people. However, with the decline of the forestry and mining industries, Neiwan’s prosperity also went from noisy to quiet.\nWIKIPEDIA\n","path":null},{"url":"https://salif.github.io/zola-themes-collection/demo/jiufen/travel/travel001/","title":"teavel JiuFen","description":"","body":"Jiufen is the name of an old street located on the island of Formosa (Taiwan).\nIf you have the chance, you should definitely visit this island to experience life here.\nAttractions\nJiufen, which was rich in gold mines in the early days, was known as the “Golden Mountain City”. The settlement prospered due to the influx of gold miners, but later became quiet as the gold rush declined. In the late 1980s, the movie “A City of Sadness” came to Jiufen for filming. Jiufen’s beautiful mountains and seas, retro buildings and unique slope landscapes jumped onto the big screen, making it an aesthetic mountain city that fascinated domestic and foreign tourists.\nWIKIPEDIA\n\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://salif.github.io/zola-themes-collection/demo/jiufen/theme/","title":"List of Camp","description":"","body":"","path":null},{"url":"https://salif.github.io/zola-themes-collection/demo/jiufen/theme/theme001/","title":"install","description":"","body":"jiufen\nThe ‘jiufen’ theme is a theme that references the W3.CSS\nTemplate and incorporates ZOLA-related features.\nJiufen is the name of an old street located on the island of Formosa (Taiwan).\nIf you have the chance, you should definitely visit this island to experience life here.\nInstallation\n1.Install Zola\nZOLA DOCS Installation\n2.Initialize Site\nZOLA DOCS Initialize Site\n\n    \n        SHELL\n        \n    \n    \n\n3.1.Git Initialize\n\n    \n        SHELL\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n3.2.Download Theme\nDownload And Upzip to Theme\n4.1 Copy Sample\n\n    \n        SHELL\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n4.2.Edit Config\nZOLA DOCS Configuration\nAdjust config.toml\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n\n5.Other Options Setting\nHeader And Footer\n\nIf Not Setting Hidden Header\nCan Use Picture(html tag width set 100%)\n\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\nNavigation\nNavigation Display Control\n\nThe top (bar) and sidebar are optional, if you want the display.\n\n\nSearch\n\nOptional, if you want search\n\nOnly Support fuse_javascript\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\nHome.md\nhome.md\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n\nContext\ncontext.md\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n\ncontext/[folder]/_index.md\n\n    \n        Editor\n         Copy \n    \n    \n\n\nShortcodes\nyoutube(id=“”)\nimageh100(path=“”)\nimageh200(path=“”)\nimageh300(path=“”)\nimagehw(path=“”)\ncode(code=“”, copy=true)\ncontext\nmermaid()\ncontext\n","path":null},{"url":"https://salif.github.io/zola-themes-collection/demo/jiufen/","title":"","description":"","body":"","path":null}]
