While Zonelets is not exactly a CSS stunt or a JS mess, there are some things that took me <em>way too much time</em> to implement properly.<h2 id=yet-again-the-basics>Yet again, the basics</h2><p>Themes for Zola usually start from a <code>base.html</code> file. The <code>&LThead></code> is not that complicated; it’s just long to write. The most general <code>&LTbody></code> possible has a navbar at the top, a main section and a rather small footer; these weren’t hard either.<p>Adding a <code>content</code> Tera block makes filling the main part of a page rather simple. In fact, <code>page.html</code> (for blog posts) and <code>standalone.html</code> (for the <em>about</em> page) almost wrote themselves.<h2 id=pagination-madness>Pagination madness</h2><p>The hardest thing was to properly set up the “recent articles” section in the index. It shows the last blog entries, but no more than four; and, if there are more than four posts on the sites, then it spawns a link to the archive.<p>Since I’m not very familiar with the ins and outs of Tera templating, I struggled for half an hour, but then I finally found the correct order of <code>{% if 4 < post_section.pages | length %}</code>.<p>The archive section was much easier after all that struggle.<aside id=back-to-top><a href=#post-title>Back to top</a></aside></main><footer>Zolaets is written by <a href=https://tilde.zone/@zinricky>ZinRicky</a>, built with the <a href=https://github.com/ZinRicky/zolaets>Zolaets</a> theme for <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a> and hosted on <a href=https://neocities.org/>Neocities</a>.</footer>
