Its main gimmick is being completely manual except for a single JS script, which keeps track of the published posts. For detailed information about its use, please check the <a href=https://zonelets.net/posts/2020-11-08-Quick-Start-Guide>quick start guide</a> and the references therein.<h2 id=about-this-theme>About this theme</h2><p>This is a theme for <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a>, a static site generator that has two gimmicks:<ul><li>being a single lightweight executable, even on Windows;<li>being written in Rust (dear Rustaceans, please don’t hurt me).</ul><p>At the moment, this theme is <strong>very</strong> basic. But so is Zonelets, so I don’t mind. So far, I have implemented:<ul><li>Zonelets’s <em>Deep Blue</em> theme, i.e. the one for its main website;<li>basic blog management, i.e. a <code>posts</code> directory that accepts <code>YYYY-MM-DD-slug-of-the-post.md</code> files;<li>syntax highlighting (I just took one of Zola’s default highlighters and called it a day);<li>shortcodes for YouTube videos and Spotify playlists and albums.</ul><p>These are the things I would like to add to this theme:<ul><li>shortcodes for Bandcamp iframes;<li>a tag system;<li>an Atom feed generator.</ul><p>I accept suggestions on this theme’s <a href=https://github.com/ZinRicky/zolaets>GitHub repo</a>, but don’t expect fast replies at all 😅.<h2 id=about-me>About me</h2><p>If you are <em>really that interested</em>… I’m <a href=https://tilde.team/~zinricky/>ZinRicky</a>, an Italian 24-year-old data science student. I’m still in the “jackass of all trades” stage, but I hope it will get better someday.</main><footer>Zolaets is written by <a href=https://tilde.zone/@zinricky>ZinRicky</a>, built with the <a href=https://github.com/ZinRicky/zolaets>Zolaets</a> theme for <a href=https://www.getzola.org/>Zola</a> and hosted on <a href=https://neocities.org/>Neocities</a>.</footer>
